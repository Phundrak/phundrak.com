Hi, I’m Lucien Cartier-Tilet, a CS student studying for my Masters 2
degree in THYP (in French: *Technologies de l’Hypermédia*, in English:
*Hypermedia’s Technologies*) at the Université Vincennes Saint-Denis
(Paris 8).

I worked at VoxWave from 212 to 2018 as its co-founder and CTO. During
that time, I developed French singing vocal libraries for vocal
synthesizers, known as ALYS and LEORA.

I’m a free software enthusiast, using GNU/Linux since 2008 and Emacs
since 2016.

I spend my personnal programming projects as well as on my constructed
worlds and languages. I also like to go climbing, and hiking whenever
I have the opportunity to.

I speak natively French, and English at a native level. I also speak
some Japanese, [Lingua Franca Nova](https://elefen.org), and Norwegian
Bokmål.
