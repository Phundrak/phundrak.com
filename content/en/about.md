# About
## Introduction
This is the personal website of Lucien “Phundrak” Cartier-Tilet.

It is written with [Vuepress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/) and is
completely open-source. You can find the source code on my [personal
Gitea instance](https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/phundrak.com).
Icons used on this website come from different sources:
- [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) which I use to consolidate all the
  icons used in one font, including some icons from their default pack
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) from which most icons come
  from --- their Vue package is, in my opinion, really not usable
- The <Icon name="conlang" /> [Language Creation
  Society](https://conlang.org/) whose logo I modified in order to
  create the icon used here when referring to my constructed languages
- <Icon name="emacs" /> [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
  and <Icon name="writefreely" />
  [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org/) whose respective logo I
  partially remade as an SVG file in order to create an icon.
- <Icon name="gitea" /> [Gitea](https://gitea.io) whose logo I
  modified to be monochromatic
