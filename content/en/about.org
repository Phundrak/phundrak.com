* About
** Introduction
This is the personal website of Lucien “Phundrak” Cartier-Tilet.

It is written with [[https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/][Vuepress]] and is completely open-source. You can
find the source code on my [[https://labs.phundrak.com/phundrak/phundrak.com][personal Gitea instance]]. Icons used on this
website come from different sources:
- [[https://icomoon.io/][IcoMoon]] which I use to consolidate all the icons used in one font,
  including some icons from their default pack
- [[https://fontawesome.com/][FontAwesome]] from which most icons come from --- their Vue package
  is, in my opinion, really not usable
- The {{{icon(conlang)}}} [[https://conlang.org/][Language Creation Society]] whose logo I modified in
  order to create the icon used here when referring to my constructed
  languages
- {{{icon(emacs)}}} [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and {{{icon(writefreely)}}} [[https://writefreely.org/][WriteFreely]] whose respective
  logo I partially remade as an SVG file in order to create an icon.
- {{{icon(gitea)}}} [[https://gitea.io][Gitea]] whose logo I modified to be monochromatic
