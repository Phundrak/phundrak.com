* Introduction
KEINE Tashi is a character and set of vocal libraries developed for
the shareware [[http://utau2008.web.fc2.com/][UTAU]], a singing voice synthesizer. I developed KEINE
Tashi over the course of several years, from 2012 to 2015. Three vocal
libraries have been released to the public, the most used one being
his *JPN Power Extend* one. On March 10th, 2017, I announced I would
cease any kind of activity related to UTAU.

- Dislikes :: selfishness, lies, arrogance
- Personality :: Tashi is somebody very calm, sweet. He really enjoys
  old books and manuscripts, and he LOVES meditate! He's never hungry,
  so, he can stay meditating for 2~3 days meditating, just like that,
  until he realizes that he should eat something. And he always keeps
  quiet, it's really hard to make him angry.

  But when he is, his anger becomes wrath. Anyone who experienced it
  can attest how complex and difficult it is to calm him down.
  Strangely enough, shortly after being confronted by Tashi, the
  victims of this wrath see their quality of life greatly improve.
  Maybe these people needed to hear some truths they refused to face
  before?

Lama, the Venerable Shamar Rinpoche, and Tai Situ Rinpoche. If you
have any question or if you are unsure, please email me.
