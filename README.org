#+title: phundrak.com

* Introduction
This is the repository for my website [[https://phundrak.com][phundrak.com]]. While it is not
yet live on this address, development versions can be found at
[[https://alpha.phundrak.com][alpha.phundrak.com]] and [[https://beta.phundrak.com][beta.phundrak.com]] (the former follows the
=develop= branch while the latter follows the =master= branch).

* Structure of the project
** Frontend
The frontend is made with [[https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/][VuePress]], a Vue-powered static site
generator. You can find its Node.JS configuration in the [[file:package.json][package.json]]
file as well as its content and general configuration in the directory
[[file:content/][content]].

*** Installing and running
To install the NPM dependencies for the project, run one of the
following commands:
#+begin_src shell
yarn
# or
npm install # delete the yarn.lock file before
#+end_src

To run the project, run one of the following commands using the same
package manager as above:
#+begin_src shell
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
#+end_src

You can compile the website to a static website by running
#+begin_src shell
yarn build
# or
npm run build
#+end_src

The compiled version of the website can then be found in =content/.vuepress/dist=.

** Backend
This is a simple backend server written in Rust, offering a REST API
at the address =https://phundrak.com/api/v1=. It communicates with a
Redis instance in order to cache some queries the frontend makes.

*** Installing and running
The currently preferred way of running the project is through
=docker-compose= using these commands:
#+begin_src shell
docker-compose pull # retrieve the necessary images (optional)
docker-compose build
docker-compose up # add option -d to detach immediately
docker-compose down # to stop the container if you detached it previously
#+end_src
