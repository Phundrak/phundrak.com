* Introduction
This is the repository for my website [[https://phundrak.com][phundrak.com]] which contains the
code available on the =main= branch. Code available on the =develop=
branch is available at [[https://beta.phundrak.com][beta.phundrak.com]].

* Structure of the project
This website is made with [[https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/][VuePress]], a Vue-powered static site
generator. You can find its Node.JS configuration in the [[file:package.json][package.json]]
file as well as its content and general configuration in the directory
[[file:content/][content]].

** Installing and running
In order to run the website, you firts need to export all the orgmode
files to Markdown files. I recommend using =ox-gfm= to do so. If you
donâ€™t mind =package.el= installing it as well as =f.el=, you can run the
following command:
#+begin_src shell
emacs -Q --script export.el
#+end_src

To install the NPM dependencies for the project, run one of the
following commands:
#+begin_src shell
yarn
# or
npm install # delete the yarn.lock file before
#+end_src

To run the project, run one of the following commands using the same
package manager as above:
#+begin_src shell
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
#+end_src

You can compile the website to a static website by running
#+begin_src shell
yarn build
# or
npm run build
#+end_src

The compiled version of the website can then be found in =content/.vuepress/dist=.
